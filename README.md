## 📌 Project Title:
**Agentic AI: Academic Research Assistant using Watsonx.ai on IBM Cloud**

## 🎯 Problem Statement:
This project is based on **Problem Statement No. 1 – Research Agent** from the IBM SkillsBuild + Edunet Foundation + AICTE Internship 2025.

> A Research Agent is an AI system designed to assist with academic and scientific research tasks. It can autonomously search for literature, summarize papers, organize references, and generate sections of research reports. The agent leverages natural language processing (NLP) to understand queries and retrieve relevant information.
